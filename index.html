                <h2 class="header2"><b>What Are APIs?</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Application Programming Interface(API) allow applications to connect with other 3rd party applications and utilize their services. For example, Uber developer making use of Google Maps API to allow users to track their cabs.</p>
                <h2 class="header2">What is REST?</h2>
                <p class="para">There are many methods available for creating these APIs. The most popular one which is universally accepted is known as REST(Representational State Transfer). Most web applications make use of REST APIs because of the benefits they offer. Therefore it is important for technical writers to understand how REST APIs work if they are to document web application based APIs successfully.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Basic knowledge of REST is enough. You don't have to know too much about the technicalities involved.</p>

                <h2 class="header2">What Do APIs Do? How Do They Look?</h2>
                <p class="para">They display information that can be used by developers. For example uber developer will make use of Geolocation API to get the 'near by cabs' information and display the same to uber user who is trying to book a cab.</p>
                <p class="para">They are basically URLs loaded with information that gets displayed when the URL is accessed. Just like websites where different URLs direct you to different pages, in the case of APIs, different URLs come loaded with different types or sets of information that the developer might search for. </p>
                <p class="para">A sample url might look like this: <a href="#">https://api.twitter.com/1.1/</a>. You might have guessed that it belongs to twitter. You might have also guessed that the twitter apis are stored away in subdomain of twitter website.</p>
                <p class="para">But a url alone is not sufficient to get started with APIs. You need what is known as an API key.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> Since APIs deal with sensitive information, they are protected with an API key. The developers looking to subscribe to an API service have to apply for and get the API key first in order to access the service.</p>

            <section class="case-study" id="case">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>APIs - A Case Study</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Travel sites like trip advisor serve as good examples of 3rd party API consumers. The information they show on their websites that help you schedule holidays (like available flights, hotels, listing of popular places for sightseeing etc..) are all gathered from several other applications (or websites). These travel websites make money by making the lives of users like you and me (by collating and producing all the information on one screen) and in turn have to pay for the API services that they are subscribe to.</p>

                <h2 class="header2"><b>Getting Started - Making a Request, Getting a Response</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Let's first explore a free public api (that does not even need an api key) to understand how a API can be accessed and the response it spits out.</p>
                <p class="para">All you have to do is click this url: <a href="https://randomuser.me/api">https://randomuser.me/api</a> and the response gets displayed on your browser.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Before accessing the above url, ensure you have <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc">this</a> browser extension installed. The extension 'prettyfies' the response.</p>
                <h3>What is Random User API? What is it reponsible for?</h3>
                <p class="para">It's just a mock API that serves up random user data, used by designers to quickly wire up a UI without really having to setup a dedicated backend. And it also perfectly suits our purpose of learning the API basics.</p>
                <h3>How to Make Sense of the Response?</h3>
                <p class="para">Well, that takes some getting used to. The more you view and analyze, the better. But the good news is you will have a team of developers to help you with this. But the best way to start off is by analyzing easily structured data like the one thrown out by the random user database.</p>
                <p class="para">Now if you look at the response closely, you'll realize that it simply gives you the details of a user record like the name, phone number, email, address etc. At a very basic level, this is very much equivalent to a uber customer viewing his/her driver's details. Only difference is, since we don't yet have a frontend, we are being presented with the raw data. </p>
                <p class="para">There you go. We just made an API request and got the response back! </p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> Everytime you reload the browser, you will get a new random user's details. So take some time and - reload, observe and learn.</p>

            <section class="anatomy" id="parts">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>Anatomy of an API</b></h2>
                <p class="para">An official looks like this: <a href="https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en">https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en</a></p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> Clicking the above url may not give back a response to you. So it's better to get your own API key by visting: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api">https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api</a></p>
                <br />
                <p class="para">Typically, API URLs can be split into 5 sections as follows:</p>

                <h3>1. Base URL</h3>
                <p class="para">Base url is that part of the API url that remains the same for all kinds of API calls. It usually refers to the domain which houses all of the application's APIs. The general practice among web applications is to reserve a separate subdomain for hosting their APIs. If you observe the above url, you will realize that it (https://api.themoviedb.org/) is basically a subdomain of (https://www.themoviedb.org/) TMDB web application.</p>
                <p class="para" style="margin-left:30px;"><a href="#">https://api.themoviedb.org/3/</a></p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> If you see a number following the base url, then it refers to API version number. So in our case, it's version 3.</p>
                <h3>2. API Key</h3>
                <p class="para">As you can see, the above api requires an api key for it to function. API keys are usually long unique string of characters that cannot be replicated that easily. They ensure only those users (developers) who have subscribed to the API service can access the api, and not anyone else.. </p>
                <p class="para" style="margin-left:30px;"><a href="#">api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b</a></p>
                <h3>3. Resources</h3>
                <p class="para">Resources (or resource) refers to the data you are pulling out using the API. It's usually a contextual name given to the data being pulled out from the database, depending on its role within the application (that is offering APIs as a service). In the case of above url, since TMDB provides movie related information, their developers have aptly named the resource as movie.</p>
                <p class="para" style="margin-left:30px;"><a href="#">/movie</a></p>
                <h3>4. Path Parameter</h3>
                <p class="para">To understand this, you have to understand the structure of the URL. Every URL will contain a '?' mark. Values that come after the base url but before the '?' mark are known as path parameters. They are known as path parameters because these values decide the path your API request will take in order to fetch the required data. Path parameters are usually given numerical values that identify a particular resource.   </p>
                <p class="para">Every resource will have a unique id associated with it. And using these path parameters, you can pass those ids to get the desired resource. In the above url, it's happens to be movie with the id 550 that we are trying to fetch . </p>
                <p class="para" style="margin-left:30px;"><a href="#">/550</a></p>
                <h3>5. Query Parameter</h3>
                <p class="para">They key:pair values that come after the '?' mark are known as query parameters, because they help you 'query' or 'filter the data' being pulled out based on 'some criterion'. After having pulled out the resource, you can decide what you wish to see from the resource using these query parameters.</p>
                <p class="para">In the above url, the query parameter used is key:value pair 'language:en' that helps you filter out only English language movies from the list of movies that we got access to from making the API call.</p>
                <p class="para" style="margin-left:30px;"><a href="#">&language=en</a></p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> Multiple query parameters can be used at the same time. Each query parameter has to be separated by '&' </p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> The above url may or may not give a response to you. So it's better to get your own API key by visting:</p>

            <section class="api-methods" id="methods">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>REST API Methods</b></h2>
                <p class="para">REST APIs support different types of API operations. But the most popular ones are: POST, GET, PATCH and DELETE. </p>
                <p class="para">They basically help you perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on data)  operations via APIs.</p>
                <p class="para">POST corresponds to create, GET to read, PATCH to update and DELETE to delete.</p>
                <p class="para">Let's see these operations in action.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="api-methods-1" id="1">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>Available API Methods I</b></h2>
                <h3>GET Operation</h3><br />
                <p class="para">We already made an API call and got the response back by using the below url</p>
                <p class="para"><a href="https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en">https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en</a></p>
                <p class="para">What we did was basically a GET operation. </p>
                <p class="para">What GET operation does is it queries the database and gets back a specific instance of a resource. Which in our case is the movie with id=550.</p>

                <h3>GET ALL Operation</h3><br />
                <p class="para">The second type of GET operation is known as GET ALL. What this does is it gets back all the instances of a specific resource. Example: let's say the developer wants a list of all the 'trending' movies, then he or she can fetch them all by making use of GET ALL operation as follows:</p>
                <p class="para"><a href="https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en-US">https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b&language=en-US</a></p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> Notice how we no longer pass id but 'popular' path parameter for fetching all the 'trending' movies segregated under 'popular' category.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> TMDB APIs support only GET operations. They do not allow users to POST data to their database. That means PATCH and DELETE too are not possible. So to explain POST, PATCH and DELETE operations, I'll be making use of my own locally hosted server which I may publish online in the future for you to make use of. </p>
                <br />
                <p class="para">To reiterate what you have learnt, in the above url:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>https://api.themoviedb.org/3 is the base url</li>
                    <li>/movie/popular are the path parameters</li>
                    <li>api_key=6c7d27503ce09c584ac2ee601fd22e1b is the api key</li>
                    <li>&language=en-US is the query parameter</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> We will revisit GET and GET ALL operations using POSTMAN API testing tool so that you can understand them well.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="postman">
                <h2 class="header2" id="post"><b>Introducing POSTMAN - An API Testing Tool</b></h2>
                <p class="para">To perform a POST operation (or to post data to the server) we need a form that takes in user inputs. But in the case of handing over apis as a service to 3rd party applications, the need for a developing a frontend does not exist. So API testing tools like the POSTMAN are used for testing whether data submission is successful or not.</p>
                <h3>What Exactly is POSTMAN?</h3>
                <p class="para">POSTMAN helps backend developers to test whether all the endpoints in their application are working as they are supposed to. More often than not, when a software application is made, the backend is developed before the frontend is. And tools like POSTMAN act as a substitute for the frontend, helping developers to submit the data to the server/database (which is actually the job of frontend) and test whether everything is working fine.</p>
                <p class="para">In the case of handing over apis as a service to 3rd party applications, the need for developing a dedicated frontend does not exist at all - it becomes the task of the API subscriber. So tools like POSTMAN prove sufficient enough.</p>

            <section class="api-methods-2" id="2">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>Available API Methods II</b></h2>
                <p class="para">Previously we saw how the data can be read from the server using GET and GET ALL operations.</p>
                <p class="para"> Now let's take a look at how we can post (or add) data to the server using POST operation.</p>
                <p class="para">To make these explanations (and the API operations involved) more meaningful, let's again assume the example of how travel websites consume 3rd party APIs. By now, you know that the available flights information you see on those sites are served up by APIs of the respective airlines. So where you do think the info of the user trying to book a flight using the travel website would go? Yes, you guessed it right. It goes back to the airline which the user choose to travel on (where it rightfully belongs), while the travel website merely serves as the relayer of the user data.  </p>
                <p class="para">So how can a user book, update or cancel his or her flight ticket right from the travel website without actually having to visit the airline website? This is where POST, PATCH and DELETE API operations come in, that help the travel website to connect the user to the airline website, so that he or she can book, update or cancel the booked flight, in that order.</p>
                <p class="para">Now that you know what POST, PATCH and DELETE API operations are and what they do, let see them in action.</p>

                <h3>POST Operation [or POST Request]</h3>
                <p class="para">With post operation, you have to submit some data. That's a given, because how can a user book a flight without submitting his or her personal info? </p>
                <p class="para">This 'data' has to be in 'key:value' pairs. Because that's how any real world object (like user, location, flight info etc.) gets stored programmatically. We just don't get to know about it because we are presented with a User Interface (UI) on the frontend.</p>
                <p class="para">To be precise, these 'key:value' pairs are called 'objects' in coding parlance. But it's enough to know that you'll be entering data as 'key:value' pairs.</p>
                <p class="para">Moreover, with POSTMAN, it'll be as simple as filling out a form and hitting the 'send' button.</p>
                <p class="para">The video below demonstrates how you can make a post request and the type of response you might get back.</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <video controls loop style="border:1px solid black">
                        <source src="post-request.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                    </video>
                </div>
                
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The type of 'key:value' pairs you will be dealing with depends on the nature of APIs you are documenting. The response will differ too. </p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Handling POSTMAN for the first time can be pretty never wracking. But like dealing with the responses, you will get used to it overtime. Moreover, remember you will have a team of developers to help you out if you get stuck.</p>
                <h3>PATCH Operation [or PATCH Request]</h3>
                <p class="para">Patch operations help you overwrite existing data. Like, for example, user modifying his booked flight details for some reason.</p>
                <p class="para">You will need the user's id (auto-generated unique number) to perform this operation.</p>
                <p class="para">The video below demonstrates how you can make a patch request and the response you might get back.</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <video controls loop style="border:1px solid black">
                        <source src="patch-request.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                    </video>
                </div>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> To know more about user id, get in touch with the development team.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>DELETE Operation [or DELETE Request]</h3>
                <p class="para">Delete operations help you delete the data. Like, for example, user canceling his or her flight for some reason.</p>
                <p class="para">You will need the user's id (auto-generated unique number) to perform this operation too.</p>
                <p class="para">The video below demonstrates how you can make a patch request and the response you might get back.</p>
                <div class="video-container">
                    <video controls loop style="border:1px solid black">
                        <source src="delete-request.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                    </video>
                </div>
                <p class="note"><b>Note</b> To know more about user id, get in touch with the development team.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Revisiting GET and GET ALL - This Time Using POSTMAN</h3>
                <p class="para">GET ALL example: user searching for all the flights; GET example: user searching for a specific flight information.</p>
                <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> GET ALL does not require user id, while GET does.</p><br />

                <h2 class="header2"><b>Why Should You Make API Calls?</b></h2>
                <p class="para">That's a valid question. After all, as a technical writer your job is to document the technology. This is okay when it comes to documenting user interfaces and even complex technology, as long as you are sure that you have gained enough knowledge to write about it. </p>
                <p class="para">But unfortunately API writing does not work that way. You should be well versed with the responses that APIs throw back at you. In fact, you should be able to explain each and every 'key:pair' value that comes back in the response. </p>
                <p class="para">Because it's your documentation that will be explaining how your API can be successfully deployed to your API subscribers (devs). So it's always best to make the API calls and observe the responses, before you start writing your API docs.</p>

            <section id="wrap">
                <h2 class="header2"><b>That's A Wrap!</b></h2>
                <p class="para">This article is not going to talk about what should and shouldn't be included in your API documentation. There are many online resources that can help you with that. You could begin here: <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3">https://developers.themoviedb.org/3</a>. (Though it's a simple movie based api, it has been documented well. You can also make the API request and get the response back within their docs itself, without having to use POSTMAN). </p>
                <p class="para">This article deals with only the fundamentals of APIs which any technical writer should know about before getting started with API docs. Fundamentals that are often ignored leading to bad API documentation. Fundamentals that are often ignored because it can be pretty tedious to offer simple explanations to such complex stuff.</p>
                <p class="para">Hope this simple guide turns out to be a savior in its own little way to those technical writers who are venturing into the world of API writing.</p>
